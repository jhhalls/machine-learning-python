    "# How To Prepare Your Data For Machine Learning in Python with Scikit-Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "Many machine learning algorithms make assumptions about your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often a very good idea to prepare your data in such way to best expose the structure of the problem to the machine learning algorithms that you intend to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post you will discover how to prepare your data for machine learning in Python using scikit-learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Letâ€™s get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Need For Data Preprocessing\n",
    "You almost always need to preprocess your data. It is a required step.\n",
    "\n",
    "A difficulty is that different algorithms make different assumptions about your data and may require different transforms. Further, when you follow all of the rules and prepare your data, sometimes algorithms can deliver better results without the preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, I would recommend creating many different views and transforms of your data, then exercise a handful of algorithms on each view of your dataset. This will help you to flush out which data transforms might be better at exposing the structure of your problem in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preprocessing Machine Learning Recipes\n",
    "This section lists 4 different data preprocessing recipes for machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the recipes were designed to be complete and standalone.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can copy and paste them directly into your project and start working.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pima Indian diabetes dataset is used in each recipe. This is a binary classification problem where all of the attributes are numeric and have different scales. It is a great example of dataset that can benefit from pre-processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can learn more about this data set on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Pima+Indians+Diabetes) webpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each recipe follows the same structure:\n",
    "1. Load the dataset from a URL.\n",
    "2. Split the dataset into the input and output variables for machine learning.\n",
    "3. Apply a preprocessing transform to the input variables.\n",
    "4. Summarize the data to show the change.\n",
    "The transforms are calculated in such a way that they can be applied to your training data and any samples of data you may have in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [scikit-learn documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html) has some information on how to use various different preprocessing methods. You can review the [preprocess API in scikit-learn here](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.preprocessing).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Rescale Data\n",
    "When your data is comprised of attributes with varying scales, many machine learning algorithms can benefit from rescaling the attributes to all have the same scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often this is referred to as normalization and attributes are often rescaled into the range between 0 and 1. This is useful for optimization algorithms in used in the core of machine learning algorithms like gradient descent. It is also useful for algorithms that weight inputs like regression and neural networks and algorithms that use distance measures like K-Nearest Neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can rescale your data using scikit-learn using the [MinMaxScaler](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) class."
