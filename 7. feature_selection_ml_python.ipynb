    "# Feature Selection For Machine Learning in Python\n",
    "The data features that you use to train your machine learning models have a huge influence on the performance you can achieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Irrelevant or partially relevant features can negatively impact model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post you will discover automatic feature selection techniques that you can use to prepare your machine learning data in python with scikit-learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature Selection\n",
    "Feature selection is a process where you automatically select those features in your data that contribute most to the prediction variable or output in which you are interested.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having irrelevant features in your data can decrease the accuracy of many models, especially linear algorithms like linear and logistic regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three benefits of performing feature selection before modeling your data are:\n",
    "* Reduces Overfitting: Less redundant data means less opportunity to make decisions based on noise.\n",
    "* Improves Accuracy: Less misleading data means modeling accuracy improves.\n",
    "* Reduces Training Time: Less data means that algorithms train faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature Selection for Machine Learning\n",
    "This section lists 4 feature selection recipes for machine learning in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "This post contains recipes for feature selection methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each recipe was designed to be complete and standalone so that you can copy-and-paste it directly into you project and use it immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recipes uses the Pima Indians onset of diabetes dataset to demonstrate the feature selection method. This is a binary classification problem where all of the attributes are numeric.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Univariate Selection\n",
    "Statistical tests can be used to select those features that have the strongest relationship with the output variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scikit-learn library provides the [SelectKBest](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.SelectKBest.html#sklearn.feature_selection.SelectKBest) class that can be used with a suite of different statistical tests to select a specific number of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example below uses the chi squared (chi^2) statistical test for non-negative features to select 4 of the best features from the Pima Indians onset of diabetes dataset."
